This will build gcc for Cortex MX based mcu:s like the stm32 for Ubuntu.
For more info http://fun-tech.se/stm32/

To run the scripts to this:
chmod 755 setup.sh
./setup.sh 

Then you just have to wait a moment.

If it did not work you can have a look in the build log 
called something like log_stm32_build_2011-04-08_153242.log
to find the problem.

But if it did build in a correct way, 
go ahead and build something funny with it.
After all that is why I call it fun tech...
